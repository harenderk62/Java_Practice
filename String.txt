7. String Anagram Check
Problem: Write a program to check if two strings are anagrams (i.e., both strings contain the same characters in the same frequency).
Steps:
Sort both strings and compare them.
Alternatively, use a frequency array or HashMap to check if both strings have the same character frequencies.

8. Substring Search
Problem: Write a program to check if one string is a substring of another.
Steps:
Use the contains method or indexOf to check if the substring exists within the main string.

9. Convert String to Integer
Problem: Write a program to convert a string to an integer without using the built-in parseInt method.
Steps:
Iterate through the string and convert each character to its integer value.
Use mathematical operations (e.g., multiplication by 10 and addition) to build the integer.

10. Count Vowels and Consonants
Problem: Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
Steps:
Loop through the string and check if each character is a vowel or consonant.
Use Character.toLowerCase() to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters.

11. Find All Permutations of a String
Problem: Write a program to print all permutations of a given string.
Steps:
Use recursion to generate all permutations of the string.
Keep track of the characters used and avoid duplicates.

12. Replace All Occurrences of a Substring
Problem: Write a program to replace all occurrences of a substring with another substring in a given string.
Steps:
Use the replace or replaceAll method to replace substrings.

13. Count the Number of Words in a String
Problem: Write a program to count the number of words in a string.
Steps:
Split the string by spaces or using regular expressions and count the resulting words.

14. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Problem: Write a program to find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Steps:
Use a sliding window approach with two pointers to check each substring.

15. Swap Two Strings Without Using a Temporary Variable
Problem: Write a program to swap two strings without using a temporary variable.
Steps:
You can swap strings using string concatenation or other techniques.
